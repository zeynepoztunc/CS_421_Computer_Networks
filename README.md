This repository contains the homeworks that I did for Bilkent CS421 Computer Networks Course.
- `Homework 1` : Wireshark Assignment
   - `Description`:  In this homework assignment, we were asked to investigate application layer protocols such as HTTP and DNS by using packet analyzing sofwtare Wireshark. In HTTP, I analyzed basic HTTP get/response interactions, HTTP conditional get/response interactions, retriving long documents, HTML documents with embedded objects and HTTP authentication by examining the packets captured. In DNS, I have analyzed nslookup and ipconfig commands, and I have also used Wireshark for tracing Dns.

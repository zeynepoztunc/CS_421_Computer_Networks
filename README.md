- `Homework 1` : Wireshark Assignment
   - `Description`:  In this homework assignment, we were asked to investigate application layer protocols such as HTTP and DNS by using packet analyzing sofwtare Wireshark. In HTTP, I analyzed basic HTTP get/response interactions, HTTP conditional get/response interactions, retriving long documents, HTML documents with embedded objects and HTTP authentication by examining the packets captured. I have examined the HTTP request/response messages, their contents, their status' and codes, the IP addresses of the destined messages and so on. In DNS, I have analyzed nslookup and ipconfig commands, and I have also used Wireshark for tracing DNS. I have examined the DNS queries, their contents, their types, the IP addresses of DNS servers.
